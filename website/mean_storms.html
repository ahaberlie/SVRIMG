<h3 class="w3-justify">Abstract</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">
    This research quantifies the spatiotemporal statistics of composite radar reflectivity in the vicinity of severe
    thunderstorm reports. By using over 20 years (1996–2017) of data and 500,000 severe thunderstorm reports, this
    study presents the most comprehensive analysis of the mesoscale presentation of radar reflectivity composites
    during severe weather events to date. We first present probability matched mean composites of approximately 5,000
    radar images centred on tornado reports that contain one of three types of manually‐labelled convective storm
    modes—namely, (a) quasi‐linear convective system (QLCS); (b) cellular; or (c) tropical system. Next, we generate
    composites for tornado report data stratified by EF‐scale and for four temporal periods during which notable
    severe weather events took place. The data are then stratified by hazard, region, season, and time of day. The
    results show marked spatiotemporal and intra‐hazard variability in radar presentation. In general, cellular
    convection is favoured in the Great Plains of the United States, whereas QLCS convection is favoured in the
    Southeast United States. Night and cool‐season subsets showed a preference for QLCS convection, whereas day
    and warm‐season subsets showed a preference for cellular convection. These results agree well with the existing
    literature and suggest that the data extraction and organization approach is sound. Because of this, these data
    will be useful for future image classification studies in climate and atmospheric sciences—particularly those
    involving storm mode classification.</p>

<h3 class="w3-justify">1. Introduction</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">Severe thunderstorm events are responsible for many weather-related injuries, deaths,
    and billion-dollar-losses in the United States (Ashley, 2007; Black and Ashley, 2010; Schoen and Ashley, 2011;
    Smith and Katz, 2013). Due to their high-impact nature, reports of these events—including when and where
    they occurred—have been gathered and systematically archived for decades by organizations like the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center. Examples of how these data are used include
    storm warning verifica- tion (Brooks and Correia Jr., 2018), generating hazard climatologies
    (Brooks et al., 2003; Allen and Tippett, 2015; Edwards et al., 2018), informing teleconnection relation- ships
    (Allen et al., 2015), exploring changes in the spatio-temporal occurrence of events (Brooks et al., 2014; Gensini
    and Brooks, 2018), vulnerability and exposure analyses (Strader et al., 2017), and environmental analyses
    (Thompson et al., 2012). Of particular interest in the field of severe thunderstorm research has been the
    automated identification of convective storm mode (CSM) in weather radar data through manual
    (Smith et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2019) or automated approaches (Haberlie and Ashley, 2018; Gagne II et al., 2019;
    McGovern et al., 2019; Jergensen et al., 2020).
    <br><br>
    Weather radar data has been used for decades to identify CSM (e.g., Fujita, 1965). CSM identification can help
    assess the potential severity of an ongoing or imminent severe weather event (McNulty, 1995; Smith et al., 2012),
    and can also be a useful tool for assessing operational (Snively and Gallus Jr., 2014) and climate model
    (Haberlie and Ashley, 2019) performance. The maturation of historical weather radar data archives has
    allowed the climatological exploration of radar-derived event (e.g., thunderstorms, CSM) frequency (Matyas, 2010;
    Fabry et al., 2017). For example, mean composite frequency of radar-derived events has been used to explore
    the relationship between locations with significant human-made land use modification and thunderstorm frequency
    (Ashley et al., 2012; Haberlie et al., 2015). Additionally, the millions of radar images generated and archived
    since the 1990s have been a great resource for applied machine learning researchers in the atmospheric and climate
    sciences (McGovern et al., 2019), including projects that train machine learning algorithms to identify CSM
    (e.g.,  Haberlie  and  Ashley,  2018;  Ashley  et al., 2019; Jergensen et al., 2020). However, until now, there
    has been no attempt to create a curated dataset of radar images centred on classifiable “objects.” These types of
    datasets are common in the field of machine learning, and are widely used for comparing the efficacy of different
    approaches. For example, the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998)—a collection of hand-written numbers—is publically
    available and has been referenced by tens of thousands of papers. Domain-specific examples include images of
    galaxies (Lintott et al., 2011) and satellite   images   centred   on   tropical   systems
    (Knapp  et al., 2016). This work is the first step in communicating the general attributes of this novel dataset
    which can inform future projects that use these data.
    <br><br>
    This work seeks to extend the methodology used by “stationary window” radar analyses by instead centring the
    radar images to be composited on locations and times at which reported thunderstorm hazards occurred. This
    moving window approach has been used in previous  work to assess the influence of multiple cities on
    thunderstorm activity (Fabry et al., 2017), generate composites of  current  and  future  heavy  rainfall
    events  (Prein et al., 2017), the successes and failures of machine learn- ing model predictions
    (McGovern et al., 2019), and the strengths and weaknesses of various multi-model averaging approaches on modelled
    rainfall output (Clark, 2017). However, those works used 10s or 100 s of “windows” and did not examine the
    spatial variability of the composites. This research expands these results to examine composites using over
    500,000 radar images from various regions, times of the day, seasons, and event magnitudes. Additionally, it could
    provide a methodology for communicating morphological variability and evolution within events of interest
    beyond morphological statistics (Zick and Matyas, 2016; Matyas et al., 2018). Through a moving window composite
    analysis, we visualize the spatiotemporal patterns in radar reflectivity in the vicinity of severe thunderstorm
    events in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Additionally, we show that the spatial, seasonal, and diurnal
    composite CSM tendencies match  with those of existing CSM climatologies. This suggests that the dataset created
    through this work will be useful for machine learning applications, and in  particular, CSM identification using
    image classification algorithms (LeCun et al., 1998).

<h3 class="w3-justify">2 Data and Methods</h3>
<h4 class="w3-justify">2.1 Radar data</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">This study utilizes historical (1996–2017) national reflec- tivity composite mosaic (2 × ~ 2 km
    grid spacing) data called NOWradtm (The Weather Company). The  raw  data, which are integers (0–16) representing
    5 dBZ bins from 0 to 80 dBZ, are sampled at 15-min intervals and interpolated to a 2 × 2 km (4 km2) equal area
    grid that spans the CONUS in a rectangle from approximately 110–65 W and 25–50 N. These data have been used in
    a number of climatological studies (Fabry et al., 2017). Although issues exist within radar datasets, some of
    these are reduced in composite reflectivity by using data from multiple radars (Fabry et al., 2017). We address
    range- and terrain-based issues by limiting the study area to regions with good low-level radar coverage east of
    the Rocky Mountains (Figure 1). One important caveat  is that dBZ was used in all calculations, and the values
    were not first converted to Z. Although the literature has argued for both approaches (Lakshmanan, 2012; Warren
    and Protat, 2019), these differences will not have a large influence on the interpretation of the results.

</p>
<h4 class="w3-justify">2.2 Severe weather event data</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">The Storm Prediction Center's severe report dataset was used for event selection
    (SVRGIS; http://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis). Although the dataset contains well-known biases (Allen and
    Tippett, 2015; Edwards et al., 2018), no initial filtering is performed. All reports from 1996 to 2017 are
    cross-referenced with time-indexed radar reflectivity data to only select event reports that occurred within
    7.5 min of available 15-min radar data. An additional step subsets the data  within  the central and eastern
    CONUS where event locations are at least 256 km from the edge of the interpolated radar domain (Figure 1).
</p>

        <img src="publication/figures/Fig1.png" style="width:100%">
        <br>Figure 1 - Study domain (black outline) and data from 1996 to 2017 for (a) severe weather report locations,
            and annual mean “report box” frequencies for (b) tornadoes, (c) hail, and (d) wind. The black dashed
            box in (b-d) represents an example of the extent of a 512 × 512 km “report box”
    </div>
<p class="w3-justify">
    After the filtering process is completed, over 90% of the original severe reports—24,940 tornado, 247,875
    hail, and 275,568 wind—are retained. The large sample size, cross-referencing with radar data, and no temporal
    trend analyses limit the  influence  of  the  biases  in   the   dataset.   The   starting   coordinates (e.g.,
    “slat,” “slon”) are used to determine the report's location.

</p>
<h4 class="w3-justify">2.3 Selection of radar data using filtered SVRGIS reports</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">
    For all 548,383 filtered reports, radar data within a 256 by 256 pixel (~512 by ~512 km) box (herein, report box)
    around the report's converted grid coordinate are extracted and saved (Figure 1b–d). This distance was chosen to
    represent the mesoscale neighbourhood around each report since all CSMs exist within the meso-gamma to lower
    meso-alpha range (Markowski and Richardson, 2011). To examine the accuracy of the process, bulk radar statistics
    within 64 km of the report's grid location were calculated. Over 99% of the events had at least 40 km2
    (roughly the size of a convective cell; Miller  and Mote, 2017) of 40 dBZ or greater pixels in the buffer region.
    That is, almost all of the filtered reports were near legitimate (i.e., non-noise) dBZ values commonly
    associated with deep, moist convective precipitation rates (Parker and Knievel, 2005). These images are used to
    generate composites.
</p>
<h4 class="w3-justify">2.4 Archetype generation</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">
    To  examine  the  attributes  of  select  CSMs  (Gallus  Jr   et  al., 2008), an initial labelled dataset of
    5,156 images  was generated, consisting of: (a) quasi-linear convective system, or QLCS (n = 2,330), (b) Cellular
    (n = 2,453),  and (c) Tropical (n = 373) examples. To create  this  dataset, images centred on the starting
    location  of  tor-  nado reports from 1996 to 2017 were manually  assigned   to one of the aforementioned CSMs.
    Although the classi- fications are subjective, we followed the guidance of pre- vious work (e.g., Gallus Jr et al.,
    2008; Smith et al., 2012; Ashley et al., 2019; Ellis et al., 2019)—specifically, (a) QLCSs are identified by
    noting a linear organization of pixels ≥40 dBZ (i.e., at least a 3 to 1 length to width ratio) with a length
    of at least 100 km, (b) Cellular cases are identified by noting a circular organization to the ≥40 dBZ pixels
    in the vicinity of the report, and that contigu- ous circular region is entirely within a 100 × 100 km box around
    the report, and (c) Tropical cases are those that occurred near a HURDAT track (Landsea et al., 2015). The reports
    were gathered from the Southern United States (i.e., Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
    Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina).
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    Probability matched mean (PMM) composites (Ebert, 2001) are generated to visualize the tendency of reflectivity
    shape and intensity across the three CSMs and temporal periods (Figure 2).
</p>
    <div class="w3-center" style="width:80%">
        <img src="publication/figures/Fig2.png" style="width:100%">
        <br>Figure 2 - Probability matched mean composites calculated using subsets of reflectivity images centred on manually
        identified tornado (≥ EF1) reports from 1996 to 2017 in the southeast United States organized by convective
        storm mode. The convective storm modes depicted are (a, b, c) QLCS, cellular, and tropical, (d, e, f) QLCS,
        (g, h, i) cellular, and (j, k, l) tropical. Three probability matched mean composites were generated from
        each convective storm mode subset, namely: (a, d, g, j) only images with distribution sums ≤25th
        percentile distribution sum, (b, e, h, k) all images, and (c, f, i, l) only images with distribution
        sums ≥75th percentile distribution sum.
    </div>
<p class="w3-justify">
    The probability matched approach is used over a simple mean because of the tendency for the latter approach to “smooth out” the large intensity
    gradients noted within precipitation rate products (Clark, 2017)—one of which is reflectivity (dBZ). This
    approach produces more realistic spatial patterns of intensity while preserving the shape of the simple mean.
    Although this approach has historically been used to assess forecast skill of accumulated precipitation fields
    (Clark, 2017) and simulated reflectivity factor (Surcel et al., 2014), recent work has used this method to
    generate representative examples of subsets using many observed radar images (McGovern et al., 2019;
    Lagerquist et al., 2020). To further illustrate the variability that is captured within the PMM composites,
    we first calculated the sums of the 25th and 75th percentile ranked intensity distributions within each subset.
    We then stratify these subsets by selecting only those images with a ranked intensity distribution sum less than
    or equal to (greater than or equal to) the 25th (75th) percentile distribution sums. In this way, we can visualize
    the extremes within the subsets, and communicate the morphological variability therein.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    To confirm that the PMM composite images are more representative than less complex approaches, we compared them to
    composite images generated by a simple mean and median using the same radar image subsets. Specifically, we
    calculated the ranked reflectivity (dBZ) found within the composites (i.e., mean, median, and PMM) and compared
    those to the median ranked reflec- tivity for the entire subset (Figure 3).
</p>
    <div class="w3-center" style="width:80%">

        <br>Figure 3 - Median ranked intensity (black line) in units of dBZ for all images within each convective storm mode
        subset, namely (a) QLCS, cellular, and tropical, (b) QLCS, (c) cellular, and (d) tropical. For each subset,
        ranked intensity is also plotted for composite images generated using a probability matched mean
        (red dashed line), simple mean (black dotted line), and median (black dash-dotted line). The regions
        representing the ≤25th percentile (lightest green), 25th to 75th percentile (medium green), and 75th to
        maximum (darkest green) distribution regions are colour filled.

    </div>

<p class="w3-justify">
    The simple mean composite image
    produces much broader areas of lower reflectivity values (i.e., <15 dBZ) and fails to reproduce higher reflectivity
    values (i.e, >15 dBZ) compared to any given image within the subset. The median composite image generally
    produces representative coverage for low reflectivity values, but, like the simple mean, it fails to reproduce
    higher reflectivity values. Ranked reflectivity from the PMM composite image, however, closely traces the median
    reflectivity ranks for all CSMs, suggesting it is representative of the intensity distribution one would see
    within the samples. This is consistent with previous work that demonstrated the advantages of PMM composites
    over the simple ensemble mean of precipitation accumulation, particularly for higher intensity values (Clark, 2017).
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    The resulting PMM composites suggest that, for all of the selected tornado reports, the composite generated using
    affiliated 25th percentile radar images (Figure 2a) resemble Cellular CSM, whereas the composite of 75th percentile
    images (Figure 2c) resemble QLCS CSM. The ranks for the first 0 dBZ pixel suggests that the median coverage of
    ≥5 dBZ pixels is around 36%, whereas this value is 47% for the 75th percentile distribution and 24% for the 25th
    percentile distribution (Figure 3a). QLCS samples (Figure 2d,e,f) tend to exhibit an elongated area of higher
    reflectivity values, and this pattern is consistent for the 25th and the 75th percentile composite images.
    The median coverage of non-zero pixels for QLCS images is around 42%, and the 25th and 75th percentile coverage
    are ~33% and ~52%, respectively (Figure 3b). On the other hand, Cellular examples (Figure 2g,h,i) show some
    variability  between  the  25th  percentile  images   (Figure 2g) and the 75th percentile images (Figure 2i).
    Namely, there is a marked increase in coverage of non-zero reflectivity values for the 75th percentile images.
    This is the result of “cell-in-cluster” cases, which contrast the “isolated cellular” examples that comprise the
    25th percentile subset. Median, 25th, and 75th percentile coverage of non-zero pixels are approximately 26%,
    17%, and 37%, respectively, for Cellular examples (Figure 3c). A noticeable and ubiquitous difference between
    the QLCS and Cellular composites is the lack of 30 dBZ and greater reflectivity values in the southern two-fifths
    of the Cellular composite images. This reflects the non-contiguous nature of “cell-in-cluster” CSM and the
    preference for tornado formation in “tail-end Charlies,” or supercells that are on the southern flank of a
    storm cluster (Beveridge et al., 2019). Tropical examples (Figure 2j–l) generally produce more widespread
    reflectivity values compared to Cellular, but have intensities lower  than both QLCS and Cellular samples.
    Additionally, the westward offset of lower intensities for Tropical samples, particularly for the overall
    composite (Figure 2k)  and 75th percentile composite (Figure 2l), matches up well with the preferred
    location of tornadoes relative to the centre of circulation for land falling storms in the CONUS (Edwards, 2012).
    Median, 25th, and 75th percentile cover- age of non-zero pixels for Tropical samples are approximately 50%, 39%,
    and 62%, respectively  (Figure 3d). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the QLCS/Cellular/Tropical composite depicted in
    Figure 2b appears as a combination of the QLCS and Cellular composites  (i.e., “mixed mode”), due to their
    abundance within the manually labelled data. It is also clear that Tropical samples generally have more non-zero
    pixels than QLCS and Cellular examples. However, median ≥ 40 dBZ cover- age is greater for both QLCS (3.3%) and
    Cellular (2.2%), compared to Tropical (1.5%). These PMM composite archetypes and statistics are reasonable and
    can be used to qualitatively assess the CSM tendency within various subsets of unlabelled images.

<p class="w3-justify">
    Specifically, we generated images  for  the:  (a)  April  27, 2011 tornado outbreak (Knupp et al., 2014);
    (b) 24–25 September 2005 Hurricane Rita tornadoes (Moore and Dixon, 2011); (c) 4–5 April 2011 serial derecho
    event (Corfidi et al., 2016); and (d) June 29, 2012 progressive derecho event (Corfidi et al., 2016). The
    purpose of these analyses is to further communicate the utility of the com- posites, as well as identify the
    variability seen within even the same type of severe weather report. This also provides further verification
    that the approach is produc- ing reasonable results by affording a qualitative compari- son to the radar
    presentation during these well-documented events.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    For the April 27, 2011 event, we focused on the early afternoon to evening period (1800 UTC to 0300 UTC).
    This period was chosen for demonstration purposes because the predominant storm mode for tornado producing
    storms was cellular (Knupp et al., 2014), and this tendency is clearly illustrated in Figure 4a–c. Specifically,
    the pattern shows a strong, high intensity (>50 dBZ), “kidney-bean-shaped” region within 25 km of the center of
    the image (i.e., the location of the storm reports) in the overall PMM composite (Figure 4b), as well as the
    25th (Figure 4a) and 75th percentile (Figure 4c) composites. Additionally, the northern half of the composite
    has greater coverage of high-intensity pixels, which matches the regional radar depiction during this event.
    The variability between the 25th and 75th percentile images denote the “isolated cellular” and “cell-in-cluster”
    events that occurred during this event, and the overall composite reflects these tendencies. Similarly,
    the composite from the Rita event—where reports were selected from 1400 UTC on September 24, 2005 to 0000
    UTC on September 26, 2005—depicts a “bulls-eye” in the center of the image, but with a contrasting northward
    (Figure 4d) and westward preference (Figure 4e,f) of higher pixel coverage. This pattern represents the
    preferred location of tornado reports  relative  to  the  center  of  Rita (Edwards, 2012) and the evolution
    of this location during the event. Initially, tornadoes were observed in the upper right quadrant of the storm,
    but this region shifted to the lower right quadrant later in the period. For the wind report examples, the squall
    line that produced a serial derecho (Corfidi et al., 2016) is clearly resolved within the 25th percentile
    (Figure 4g), overall (Figure 4h) and 75th percentile (Figure 4i) composites that include  images from 1300
    UTC on April 4, 2011 to 0300 UTC on April 5, 2011. Only the central part of the images depicts the classic
    “quasi-linear” region of high-intensity pixels associated with intense squall lines due to the shifting
    orientation of the squall line across its ~1000 km axis. Similarly, the progressive derecho event of June 29, 2012
    (Figure 4j–l) captures the comparatively more compact linear structure and trailing-stratiform precipitation that
    is typical of the leading-line/trailing-stratiform pattern (Parker and Johnson, 2000). Similar to the Rita event,
    the stratification by percentile appears to capture the initial cellular structure across the Midwest and the
    leading-line/trailing-stratiform structure as it moved to the east coast later in its life cycle. Again,

    illustrates that the PMM approach is more representative of the reflectivity distribution than the mean or median
    composite images for these events. The April 27th 2011 event (Figure 5a) and the June 2012 derecho both have lower
    median coverage of non-zero pixels compared to the Rita event (Figure 5b) and the progressive derecho event
    (Figure 5c). Although there is variability in the orientation, intensity, and location of CSM structures
    relative to storm reports, tendencies in reflectivity patterns are captured by the composites.

<h4 class="w3-justify">3.2 Composites stratified by tornado damage rating</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">
    Previous work has shown a strong relationship between CSM and EF-scale  rating  (Trapp  et  al.,  2005;
    Smith et al., 2012; Ashley et al., 2019). Namely, a Cellular CSM is most commonly associated with significant
    (≥EF2) to violent (≥EF4) tornadoes. Thus, composites stratified by EF-scale rating should reflect these findings.
    For all tornado events considered in this study that were given a rating (n = 24,850), their associated images
    were stratified into groups ranging from EF0 to EF5 (Figure 6; Figure 7).

<p class="w3-justify">
    Indeed, the PMM composites show a steady
    transition from “mixed mode” QLCS and Cellular CSM archetypes (Figure 2) for EF0 to EF2 (Figure 6) to cellular for
    EF3 and EF4 (Figure 7a–f) to isolated cellular for EF5 (Figure 7g–i). Although there is variability within these
    composites, there is a clear trend of a reduction in reflectivity coverage consistent with a shift from QLCS to
    Cellular CSM as EF-scale rating increases (Figure 8).
</p>

        <img src="publication/figures/Fig8.png" style="width:100%">

    </div>

<p class="w3-justify">
    There is also a marked reduction in the coverage of non-zero
    pixels in the “maximum” ranked distribution as rating increases. More modest reductions within increasing
    EF-scale rating are evident in the median, 25th, and 75th percentile non-zero pixel coverage, with coverage
    maximizing at EF1 (32%, 21%, and 45%, respectively), and minimizing for EF5s (18%, 12%, and 31%, respectively).
    Interestingly, however, even the EF3 and EF4 composites have areas of mean convective (≥ 40 dBZ) reflectivity
    extending to the north, which suggests the pos- sibility of more specific CSMs like those proposed by Smith
    et al. (2012), namely, cell-in-line and cell-in-cluster, in addition to QLCS. This “mixed-mode” is illustrated
    by the differences between the 25th (Figure 6a,d,g;  Figure 7a,d) and 75th (Figure 6c,f,i; Figure 7c,f) percentile
    PMM composite images—specifically, the Cellular CSM in the 25th percentile images and the QLCS/clustered CSM in
    the 75th percentile images. The CSMs depicted in the 75th percentile images are  associated with problematic
    issues like the highest fatality and  injury  rate  per  tornado  (supercell   in  line;  Brotzge   et al.,
    2013) and lowest probability of detection (QLCS; Brotzge et al., 2013). These results affirm that even significant
    to violent tornadoes can occur in “messy” or mixed-mode mesoscale convective scenarios, leading to reductions in
    warning efficacy.
<h4 class="w3-justify">3.3 Spatiotemporal variability of composites</h4>
<p class="w3-justify">
    To facilitate spatial analyses and comparisons, the east- ern CONUS is organized into 29 512 × 512 km grids and
    one ocean control grid (Figure 9).
</p>
    <div class="w3-center" style="width:80%">

        <br>Figure 9 - As in Figure 2, except for (a) all severe weather events, (b) tornado events, (c) hail events,
        and (d) wind events from 1996 to 2017 that are spatially filtered by grid (1–30) region. A minimum of 10
        reports within a grid was necessary to plot the composites. Each box has the dimensions of 512 × 512 km.
    </div>


<p class="w3-justify">
    Storm reports are associated with a grid using a one-to-one spatial join in ArcGIS Pro. Next, PMM composites are
    generated for each grid by only using images associated with reports that occur within that grid (Figure 9).
    For example, the image plotted within grid 22 (Birmingham) in Figure 9a is the PMM composite for all images
    associated with any severe (tornado, hail, and wind) report that occurred within that grid cell.
    All of the PMM composite images have the same scale as the original data. That is, the PMM composite is inserted
    onto the 2-km equal area grid by anchoring the centre of the image on the pixel closest to the centroid  of  each
    grid,  and  filling  out  128 pixels to the north, south, east and west of that cen- tral pixel. Through this
    analysis, we can assess the spatial variability in “typical” radar reflectivity appearance. The colour map used
    in the composite figures was chosen to replicate the typical colour scale used when presenting weather radar
    reflectivity. The authors feel that the disadvantages of the generally poor colour map choice are balanced by
    the familiarity experts and non-experts have with this colour scale.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    Marked spatial patterns are illustrated by stratifying the data into gridded regions. The composites for all
    events (Figure 9a), as well as those stratified by hazard type (Figure 9b–d), show a tendency for radar images
    to exhibit a more cellular appearance in the High Plains  with an increasingly QLCS-like appearance in Southeast
    CONUS. This pattern is particularly evident within the tornado composites (Figure 9b). Southern Great Plains
    tornado grids (e.g., 14-Wichita and 20-Dallas) match up well with the cellular archetype depicted in Figure 2g-i,
    whereas tornado grids within the Southeast  CONUS  (e.g., 21-Little Rock and 22-Birmingham)  match  with the QLCS
    archetype (Figure 2d–f). Conversely, hail composites (Figure 9c) suggest that the preferred storm mode is
    predominately cellular. Although, the cells appear to be more isolated in grids like 13-Denver compared to
    16-Nashville. Wind composites (Figure 9d) show a QLCS-like pattern in the Southeast CONUS, and a “mixed mode”
    pattern as depicted in Figure 2b in the Midwest CONUS. The lack of ≥5 dBZ to the NW and SE of severe thunderstorm
    reports is expected and ubiquitous throughout the composites. The initiation and sustenance of deep,
    moist convection that produces severe weather requires a lifting mechanism, which is typically provided by frontal
    boundaries (McNulty, 1995). To the NW of the report, this is often an area where cold or dry air has undercut warm
    or moist air, and instability has decreased. To the SE of the report, this area often experiences a capping
    inversion and air parcels are spatially displaced from an adequate lifting mechanism.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
Extending the analysis to warm (April–September) and cool (October–March) seasons reveals temporal  variability within
    the grids (Figure 10).

    </div>


<p class="w3-justify">
    In general, the spatial coverage of the “mean storm” either increases or becomes more
    elongated during the cool season, particularly for tornado and wind events. Summer tornado events produce
    composites most similar to the cellular archetype (Figure 2g–i) in the Great Plains and Midwest CONUS, and an
    increasing QLCS-like pattern as one moves into the Southeast CONUS (Figure 10a). Focusing on the eastward
    transition between grids 19-Amarillo, 20-Dallas, 21-Little Rock, and 22-Birmingham, there is a clear evolution
    from cellular to QLCS-like composites. In contrast, the eastward transition from 7-Casper, 8-Sioux Falls,
    9-Des Moines, and 10-Chicago shows a more subtle cellular to QLCS-like transition, potentially caused by more
    compact QLCSs or a more balanced mix of Cellular and QLCS structures compared to the Southeast. Perhaps not
    surprisingly, 27-Baton Rouge, 28-Mobile, and 29-Orlando, exhibit a Tropical-like structure in their warm-season
    tornado composites. These CSMs shift towards QLCS-like structures in the  cool  season   (Figure 10b),
    and this change is ubiquitous across the grids. This shift is not as obvious for  hail  events  (Figure 10c–d),
    and although a clear elongation of the spatial coverage of reflectivity intensity is noted, the best qualitative
    fit for the grids would still be the cellular archetype in Figure 2g–i. Similar to the tornado composites, the
    composites for wind events shift from a cellular or mixed-mode pattern in the warm season to a QLCS pattern in
    the cool season (Figure 10e,f). The seasonal dichotomy could be explained by a balance between instability and
    convective inhibition. Convective (≥40 dBZ) reflectivity values are often associated with vigorous deep, moist
    convection (Ashley et al., 2012), and environ- mental conditions that support such convection have favourable
    thermodynamics and kinematics (McNulty, 1995). However, the utilization of these ingredients by potential storms
    is conditioned on other factors such as the strength of a capping inversion and forcing for ascent. During
    the spring and early summer, a large portion of the study area experiences supportive thermodynamics, kinematics,
    and conditional environmental factors that lead to the frequent development of widespread convection (Doswell, 2001;
    Gensini and Ashley, 2011). Moving into the late summer and early fall, stronger capping inversions and weaker forcing
    can limit the coverage of convection. The result within the composites is the contraction of the “mean storms”
    due to the limited coverage of non-zero reflectivity values as a response to increasingly localized and less
    widespread supportive environments during this period.

</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    We stratified the reports into two subsets to examine the influence time of day had on the composites,  namely:
    (a) an early afternoon and early evening subset  (1700–0500 UTC); and (b) a night and morning subset (0500–1700 UTC).
    The limitations of choosing these sub- sets is that the amount of daylight hours, as well as local noon and local
    midnight, differs over the course of a year and within the study area. Thus, these periods should be considered
    only roughly representative of the typical time periods in which initial convection develops (early afternoon
    and evening) and when upscale growth  has occurred (night and morning) based on previous work
    (Carbone and Tuttle, 2008). Similar patterns to the seasonal analyses emerge from the diurnally-stratified
    composites (Figure 11).

        <br>Figure 11 - As in Figure 9, except for (a, c, e) “afternoon and early evening” (1700–0500 UTC), and
        (b, d, f) “night and morning” (0500–1700 UTC). For each period, the ending time is not included in that subset.
    </div>
<p class="w3-justify">
    In particular, the transition from the afternoon and evening subset to the night and
    morning subset results in an increased area covered by the 5 dBZ contour for all of the hazard types and most
    of the grids. Tornado composites (Figure 11a,b) exhibit a marked expansion in spatial coverage during the
    night and morning period, including higher intensity contours that denote regions of convection (i.e., 40 dBZ).
    Some of the more dramatic diurnal increases in reflectivity coverage includes 9-Des Moines and 15-St. Louis.
    Hail events (Figure 11c,d) experience an expansion in spatial coverage and a change in how the most intense
    reflectivities are oriented relative to the areas of weaker mean reflectivity during the night and morning
    period. Specifically, areas of higher intensity are on the southern  flank of the 5 dBZ contour region,
    whereas the afternoon to evening composites have this area on the southwest flank,  and this pattern is
    particularly evident in grids 9-Des Moines and 10-Chicago. Based on when hail typically occurs in this area
    (i.e., late spring and early summer), it is possible that this signal is related to the nocturnal low level
    jet interacting with frontal boundaries (Walters et al., 2008). Wind composites similarly show an expansion
    of weaker reflectivity (≥5 dBZ) and convective reflectivity (≥40 dBZ) for many of the grids in the night
    and morning subsets (Figure 11e,f). This strong signal suggests a preference for QLCS-like structures over
    cellular structures during this time of the day. Although peak heating occurs during the afternoon, the upscale
    growth of organized convection associated with severe thunderstorm events is largely relegated to the overnight
    hours, particularly during the summer (Carbone and Tuttle, 2008; Geerts et al., 2017). The merging and subsequent
    reinforcement of cold pools as an event matures results in the mesoscale area favourable for lifting parcels to
    the level of free convection to increase from the meso-gamma scale (~10 km) to the meso-beta scale (~100 km;
    Coniglio et al., 2010). Additionally, supportive thermody- namics and kinematics that develop exclusively during
    the overnight hours allows the development of convec- tion that is displaced from surface frontal boundaries
    (Walters et al., 2008; Weckwerth et al., 2019). The overall effect of these factors results in the increase in
    coverage of convection during the overnight and morning period.

<h3 class="w3-justify">4 Discussion and conclusions</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">
    This study used a moving window composite analysis to illustrate the climatological tendency of radar-derived
    spatial patterns affiliated with recorded severe thunderstorm hazards in the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS.
    Three CSMs were chosen to illustrate the variability between composites generated for approximately 5,000 manually
    identified QLCS, Cellular, and Tropical sam- ples. For unlabelled tornado samples, the images were first stratified
    by F/EF scale to examine the CSM ten- dency within the resulting composites. To examine the spatiotemporal
    variability of the composites, over 500,000 images were used to create composites for 30 “report box” grids over
    the eastern CONUS. This analysis informed an exploration of not only the regional variability of these
    composites, but also the seasonal and diurnal variability therein.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    The results affirm previous work that examined CSM within the CONUS (Smith et al., 2012;
    Ashley  et al., 2019). In particular, strong tornadoes were associ- ated with a “Cellular” CSM tendency,
    whereas weaker tornadoes were associated with “QLCS” or mixed Cellular/QLCS CSM tendency. CSM tendency
    within Great Plains grids was Cellular, whereas the tendency for Southeast CONUS grids was QLCS or mixed Cellular/QLCS.
    Day and warm-season events preferred a Cellular CSM, whereas cool-season and night events preferred QLCS or mixed
    Cellular/QLCS. The results show the utility of the moving window composite approach, due to its agreement with
    existing manual and automated studies of spatiotemporal CSM variability.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
    Future work using these data should explore ways of using semi-supervised (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009) machine
    learning classification techniques to assign CSM labels to the 500,000 extracted images. A large dataset of labelled
    images would be useful to the meteorology and climate research community, particularly those who are engaged in
    image classification applications. For example, these data can populate an “image search engine” that can perform
    image retrieval tasks (Guo et al., 2016). Users of  the image search engine would then be able to query the severe
    weather report dataset by the appearance of the radar image, in addition to the attributes provided within SVRGIS
    (time, location, magnitude, etc.). Such projects have been successful in other domains (LeCun et al., 1998;
    Lintott et al., 2011; Knapp et al., 2016) by: (a) providing a consistent dataset from which to draw examples;
    and (b) adding context to the performance of new machine learning approaches. Additionally, these and similar
    projects have improved public access to scientific datasets, educated non-experts on physical phenomena, and
    even included so-called “citizen scientists” in the dataset-building process. Like other projects, this dataset
    can be modular and add new data as it becomes available through a versioning process.
